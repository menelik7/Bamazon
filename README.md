A CLI e-commerce app that is cool and easy to use.  mySQL and Node.js were the tools of choice.  The app provides a hassle-free shopping experience to customer, and allows the Manager to gain easy access to his inventory and edit as needed.

2. Shopping

	* If the user decides to shop, they will enter an item_id.  The app will then display the chosen item and will prompt the user to enter a quantity.  If the item_id was invalid, the user will be prompted to re-enter a valid item_id:

	If the user entered an amount that the store can accomodate, then the customer will be given confirmation that the order has gone through, their total will be displayed, and they will have the choice to keep shopping or exit.  If they entered an amount that the store cannot accommodate, they will be shown what the store currently has on stock and prompted to enter a lower quantity:
